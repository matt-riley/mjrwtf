Write and update documentation that stays in sync with the code.

## Preferred docs targets
- `README.md` (user-facing usage + config)
- `openapi.yaml` (API contract)
- `docs/*` (deep dives like schema/docker)

## How to be effective (and concise)
- Update only the sections impacted by the change.
- Prefer one runnable example over many partial snippets.
- Keep commands aligned with `make` targets.

## When to use existing skills
- API contract edits: **http-api-openapi**
- Env/config docs: **configuration-env**
- Testing instructions: **testing-workflows**

## Output expectations
- Provide exact text to add/remove.
- Ensure examples match current flags/env vars.
